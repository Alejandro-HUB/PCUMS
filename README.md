# PCUMS

The purpose of this project is to allow the administrator to set conditions for the general 
user through monitoring their session on the system and their application’s run-time. 
In administrator mode, the user can monitor the computer’s CPU and RAM performance. 
These functions can be used for a parent restricting their kid’s usage on the computer 
as well as for preventing certain programs from overworking their computer, making 
the product a mix of a computer monitoring system and a parental control application.
